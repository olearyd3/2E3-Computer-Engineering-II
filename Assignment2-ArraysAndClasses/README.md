# Assignment 2 -- Arrays and Classes

In this assignment, you are to use a date class with arrays. Also, you'll have to do some sorting.

Using the date class, write program to read in up to 20 dates, one date per line, in the format:

year month day

To finish entering dates, enter the date:

    0 0 0
  
Here is an example of five dates being entered:

    2020 10 23
    2000 2 14
    2017 7 19
    2008 4 16
    2040 1 31
    0 0 0
    
Your program should then print the dates out , along with their day numbers, counting from 2000 1 1 in ascending order:

    2000 2 14 44
    2008 4 16 3028
    2017 7 19 6409
    2020 10 23 7601
    2040 1 31 14640
    
Your program should issue a prompt at the start:

    Enter the dates in year month day format, one per line. To finish, enter the date 0 0 0.
