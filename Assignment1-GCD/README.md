# Assignment 1 -- Getting Started.

Write a function called gcd to return the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of any two integers. The integers should be positive and non-zero.

The function should take two integers as parameters and should return an integer result. Try to ensure that the algorithm for finding the GCD is efficient. It should not need to use either division or mod functions.
Using the gcd function, write a main function to prompt the user for two numbers, compute their GCD and print it out with a message. 

Here are the details:

The prompt should be, exactly:

    Please enter the two numbers whose GCD you wish to calculate:
    
Then the program should work.

The output should be, exactly (and including the full stop):

    The GCD of [firstnumber] and [secondnumber] is [gcd].  
    
where the [firstnumber], [secondnumber] and [gcd] are replaced by the values in question, e.g: The GCD of 125 and 15 is 5.

Or, in case of an error:

    An error occurred.
    
Did we mention that the text of the prompt and the results must be exactly as specified?
